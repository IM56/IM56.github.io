## About me
Hi, my name is Ismail and I am a C++ programmer, mathematician and games enthusiast. I recently completed my MSc in Games Software Development at Sheffield Hallam University, where I learned about gameplay programming, graphics programming and low-level optimisation. Before that, I completed my BSc in Mathematics at the University of Sheffield, where I coauthored two academic papers.
