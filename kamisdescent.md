<h1>Kami's Descent</h1>

## About
*Kami's Descent* is a game prototype created using UE4 as part of my MSc in Games Software Development. Working as a team of five 
(me, another coder and three artists), we were given 10 weeks to design and develop the prototype using Scrum practices. 

The game centres around Kami and an elemental Wisp, who must work together to solve puzzles, evade traps and collect the gems to progress to the next level. Both characters have different abilities, and are controlled simultaneously by a single player.
